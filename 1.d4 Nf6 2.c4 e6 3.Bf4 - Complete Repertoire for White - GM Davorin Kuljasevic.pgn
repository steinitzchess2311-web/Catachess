-41,-45,-45,-45,-39,-44]} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Bf4 $5 {After the standard
opening moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6, White has a typical choice between 3.Nf3, 3.
Nc3 and 3.g3. All three lead to big opening variations in which the theory
branches deeply and widely. Sometimes white players avoid this early by
playing 2.Bf4 (the London system), 2.Bg5 (the Trompowsky attack) or 2.Nc3 (the
Veresov attack), trying to get a less theoretical type of game. However, all
these systems have a downside in that White usually delays or altogether omits
to play c2-c4, which decreases his influence on the centre. That said, it
might be possible to get the best of both worlds by playing 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.
Bf4!?, a variation that has been largely unexplored throughout chess history.
According to my database, the first strong players who played 3.Bf4 are
Russian grandmasters Mozharov (in 2020) and Paravyan (in 2021). These were
blitz games which they both lost as White, so one could have easily discounted
this move as a failed experiment. However, soon after the World Champion
himself, Magnus Carlsen, essayed this move in two rapid games in 2021 to score
2/2 against Wesley So and Levon Aronian! After that, other players took notice
and this young variation has, tough somewhat shyly, taken off. So far,
super-GMs Rapport, Duda, and Wojtaszek (twice!) have given it a go, as well as
a couple of other grandmasters, basically testifying to its soundness. In this
database, I would like to present a full White repertoire based on this move
that one can use as a sort of a secret weapon in their opening arsenal. In the
remainder of this introduction, I will explain and provide: 1) the positional
merits of this variation; 2) its practical aspects, and 3) the overview of the
most important variations. These variations will then be examined in detail in
the remaining four chapters. 1) Positional merits: While it has to be admitted
that all of the previously mentioned 3rd white moves seem more expedient than
3.Bf4 from a purely developmental point of view, this move is not at all
unreasonable; as any experienced 1.d4 player knows, the bishop is successfully
developed to f4 in a wide variety of opening variations in d4-systems. It
often exerts pressure along the h2-b8 diagonal and facilitates the development
of White's queenside (Nc3/d2, Rc1, etc). White's plan is typically to develop
centrally (without the g3-fianchetto) with e3/e4 and Nf3/e2, really depending
on what Black does. As we will see, the game very often transposes into some
variety of a much better-known opening, such as QGD, the London system,
Bogo-indian, Nimzo-Indian, QID, Benoni or Blumenfeld gambit. Most importantly,
the analysis shows that White's opening scheme is fundamentally sound in all
cases. 2) Practical merits: As hinted in the introduction, the most important
practical aspect of this variation is that it is likely to put the opponent
outside of their well-known opening territory, and that counts for a lot these
days. Secondly, it allows you, as the white player, to cut down on hours of
opening preparation in the main lines of the Ragozin, Semi-Tarrasch,
Nimzo-Indian, Queen's-Indian, the Catalan, etc. Thirdly, it typically leads to
positions that can be easily understood and played, even with limited
experience with certain 1.d4 positions. Yes, it will be important to remember
a couple of key moves and variations to get the most from this variation, but
these are minimal compared to the usual memorization work that one has to do
in the main lines. Fourthly, this repertoire is quite appropriate for quicker
time controls because it is more difficult for the opponent, especially a less
prepared one, to solve his opening problems than in classical time control. 
Finally, let me say that this variation is not a panacea - if Black plays the
opening well, particularly in the QGD and Bogo/Nimzo setups, it is more likely
that the game is headed for a level middlegame than not. White's advantage in
the critical lines is either minimal or we have a complex middlegame with
roughly equal chances for both sides. However, if Black goes wrong somewhere,
we have real chances to obtain an advantage. In this day and age, it is
difficult to ask anything more from an opening variation. Now, let us see
which options Black has at his disposal and what our general plan is against
each of them. In Chapter 1, we immediately tackle the most popular and
critical Black's response:} d5 ({Another very important direction is} 3... Bb4+
{White's most consistent reply is} 4. Nd2 {when we have an interesting and
rare version of the Bogo-Indian Defence. While Black has several decent
options, the most critical one is} c5 {hitting White's pawn centre.} (4... Nc6
{is a different approach that was already tried by GM Esipenko. After} 5. a3
Bxd2+ 6. Qxd2 d6 {We have a position that resembles one of the variations of
the Qc2-Nimzo. Here, I would prefer} 7. Nf3 $5 ({over Duda's} 7. O-O-O {
1/2-1/2 (43) Duda,J (2760)-Esipenko,A (2714) Wijk aan Zee 2022})) ({Black can
also play} 4... d5 5. a3 Bd6 {in order to exchange the dark-squared bishops.
White can usually obtain a very slight edge, as in a recent game by GM
Radoslaw Wojtaszek.} 6. Bxd6 Qxd6 7. e3 O-O 8. Ngf3 b6 {1-0 (64) Wojtaszek,R 
(2694)-Vrolijk,L (2476) Germany 2022}) ({Lovers of the Dutch defense
structures might prefer} 4... Nh5 5. Be3 f5 {[%csl Rd2,Re3] which seems to
work quite well for Black here considering the clumsy positions of White's two
only developed pieces. An interesting middlegame could ensue after} 6. g3 O-O
7. Bg2 Be7 8. f4 Nf6 9. Ngf3 $13 {etc.}) ({Finally,} 4... b6 5. a3 Bxd2+ 6.
Qxd2 {leads to a version of the Bogo-Indian that is favourable for White.}) {
White should release the tension with} 5. dxc5 O-O 6. e3 Bxc5 7. Ngf3 {and now
the most straightforward continuation is} d5 {taking space in the centre and,
interestingly, transposing into a variation of the London system. The pawn
structure in the arising middlegames tends to be symmetrical but the presence
of all seven pairs of pieces on the board usually makes for at least an
interesting middlegame.} ({Alternatively, Black could complete his queenside
development first with} 7... Nc6 8. a3 b6 9. Be2 Bb7 10. O-O $13) ({or} 7... b6
8. Be2 Bb7 9. O-O Be7 $13 {1-0 (33) Wojtaszek,R (2694)-Piorun,K  (2640)
Bydgoszcz 2022}) {Here, both} 8. Be2 ({and} 8. cxd5 $5 {are equally playable.})
{The main line continues} 8... Nc6 (8... d4 $5) 9. O-O b6 (9... Qe7 $5) 10. a3
Bb7 {In the game 1-0 (37) Triapishko,A (2506)-Bambino Filho,A (2160) Chess.com
INT 2022, White managed to get a slight pressure with the following sequence:}
11. cxd5 Nxd5 12. Bg3 Rc8 13. Ne4 Be7 14. Rc1 $14) ({A very principled choice
for Black is} 3... c5 {when the principled answer is} 4. d5 {Black can either
go for the Blumenfeld gambit with} b5 ({or the Benoni with} 4... exd5 5. cxd5
d6 {Experienced players will already notice how White can easily stir the game
into the main line of the Bf4-variation by playing Nc3 and Nf3 here, but for
those not willing to enter these theoretical lines, I can suggest a slightly
unusual move order:} 6. e4 $5 (6. Nc3 g6 7. Nf3 {- the main line of the Benoni
with Bf4}) 6... g6 7. Nf3 Bg7 ({the point being that} 7... a6 {is answered by}
8. Nbd2 $1) 8. Nc3 O-O (8... a6 9. Qa4+ $1) 9. Nd2 {when we get a good version
of the Benoni for White. As usual in this opening, the bishop is placed well
on the h2-b8 diagonal as it puts pressure on the weak d6-pawn. I haven't
managed to find an equalizing line for Black here in my analysis.}) 5. Nf3 {
Black has tried many moves in practice in this position and I analyzed six of
them in Chapter 3. The two most critical ones seem to be} exd5 ({and} 5... b4
6. e4 $1 Nxe4 7. Bd3 $36) 6. cxd5 Bb7 {In both cases, White's main idea is to
play} 7. e4 $1 {not minding sacrificing the central pawn in order to speed up
our development and trying to take the initiative in the opening.} Nxe4 8. Nbd2
$1 $36) ({Finally, we will take a look at the Queen's Indian approach with} 
3... b6 {as well as several minor sidelines: 3...Be7, 3...Nc6, 3...Ne4, and 3..
.Nh5. White's best choice here is to play} 4. a3 {in the spirit of the
Petrosian variation of the QID. Interestingly, there are some positive
differences in this position with Bf4 compared to the main line where the
knight is already developed on f3.} Bb7 5. Nc3 d5 {This is the most principled
approach for Black.} ({White can usually obtain an advantage after} 5... g6 6.
Nf3 Bg7 7. Qc2 $1) ({or} 5... Be7 6. d5) 6. cxd5 Nxd5 {The critical move.} (
6... exd5 {leads to a good version of the structure for White.}) 7. Nxd5 Qxd5
8. e3 {The bishop is placed well on f4, hitting the c7-pawn. Black can try to
solve issues with this pawn in one of two ways:} c5 ({or} 8... Bd6 9. Ne2 $1 {
[%cal Ge2f4,Ge2c3] The usefulness of knight's flexibility becomes apparent -
black queen will be expelled from d5 with a tempo.}) {when White has good
chances to take the initiative on the queenside exactly thanks to his quick
development on that side of the board.} 9. Nf3 {[%csl Re8][%cal Ga1c1,Gf1c4,
Gf3e5]}) {My suggestion is to continue} 4. cxd5 {before Black had time to
counterattack with ...c7-c5. The second player has two equally reasonable
replies now. 1)} Nxd5 {in the spirit of Semi-Tarrasch defense. Black wins a
tempo by hitting the bishop and prepares .. .c7-c5 next.} ({and 2)} 4... exd5 {
which leads into the QGD territory. This is a solid positional solution that
many players would resort to in order to play a familiar Carlsbad pawn
structure. White bishop is placed actively on f4 in this structure and after}
5. e3 {it only makes sense to exchange it with} Bd6 ({although Black can also
seriously consider playing} 5... Bf5 $5 {when I'd suggest that we try to
bother the bishop with} 6. Nc3 c6 7. Nge2 $1 {[%csl Rf5][%cal Ge2g3,Gh2h4] etc.
}) 6. Bxd6 Qxd6 {After} 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Nc3 {Black has a choice between several
plans. In the first chapter, I examined the following three:} b6 (8... Bg4 {
1/2-1/2 (57) Rapport,R (2763)-Wojtaszek,R (2686) Berlin 2022}) ({and} 8... c6)
9. Nf3 c5 10. O-O {White typically has good chances to obtain a minimal edge
in these positions.}) 5. Bg3 c5 6. e4 {White wins back the tempo. The real
point comes one move later, though.} Nf6 7. Nd2 $1 {A somewhat shocking pawn
sacrifice. White leaves d4-pawn for grabs, hoping to develop the initiative
thanks to the better development. Black has three possibilities here:} Qxd4 {
You could say that this is the most principled way to capture the pawn,
although I imagine that many players would avoid playing with their queen so
early in the opening.} ({In the case of} 7... cxd4 {White can obtain a typical
attacking position by playing} 8. e5 $1 Nd5 9. Ngf3 Nc6 10. Bd3 Be7 11. Rc1 O-O
12. h4 $5 {[%csl Rd4] when the opponent's pawn on d4 serves as a shield that
stops his own counterplay in the centre.}) (7... Nc6 {was So's choice against
Carlsen, when I'd like to propose} 8. dxc5 $5 {as a slightly more accurate
move order than Carlsen's 8.e5. Then, after} (8. e5 {1-0 (55) Carlsen,M (2847)
-So,W (2772) chess24.com INT 2021}) 8... Bxc5 9. e5 Nd5 10. Ngf3 O-O 11. a3 {
White may obtain a minimal edge with accurate play. The bishop is placed
conveniently on g3, covering the f4-square and supporting the e5-d6 axis 
(think: Nd2-e4/c4-d6).}) 8. Ngf3 Qd8 9. e5 Nd5 10. Bd3 {White has a palpable
lead in development that compensates for the sacrificed pawn. In the database,
I focused my analysis on the following two continuations:} Be7 ({and} 10... a6
$5 11. O-O b5) 11. O-O Nc6 12. Qe2 {We have a fresh position in which White
seems to have good attacking prospects.} *

that the analysis in this database can change this sentiment! I analyzed six

neutralize his initiative and even then fails to equalize. The bishop is

out of the scope of this database. I understand that this might mean that you
have to learn some new opening variations on your own or from other sources.
However, 95% of material in this repertoire leads into original positions for
which you don't require any outside knowledge except for, preferably, a general
understanding of certain types of positions. For the other 5%, well, don't be
lazy and make sure that you do your homework :)}) 4. a3 {Petrosian variation,

to try to make 4.a3 work with the bishop already developed to a natural
